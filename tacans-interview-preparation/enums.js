// Discuss the benefits of using enums in TypeScript. Provide an example.


//Answer:

// Enums in TypeScript provide a way to define a set of named constants. They can be useful for representing fixed values like days of the week, months of the year, or other predefined options. Enums are especially helpful when working with a limited set of options that are known at compile time.

// Here is an example of using enums in TypeScript to represent different days of the week:

enum DaysOfWeek {
  Sunday,
  Monday,
  Tuesday,
  Wednesday,
  Thursday,
  Friday,
  Saturday,
}

function getDayOfWeek(day: DaysOfWeek): string {
  switch (day) {
    case DaysOfWeek.Sunday:
      return "Sunday";
    case DaysOfWeek.Monday:
      return "Monday";
    case DaysOfWeek.Tuesday:
      return "Tuesday";
    case DaysOfWeek.Wednesday:
      return "Wednesday";
    case DaysOfWeek.Thursday:
      return "Thursday";
    case DaysOfWeek.Friday:
      return "Friday";
    case DaysOfWeek.Saturday:
      return "Saturday";
    default:
      return "Invalid day";
  }
}

const currentDay: DaysOfWeek = DaysOfWeek.Monday;

console.log(`Today is ${getDayOfWeek(currentDay)}`);

// In this example, we define an enum DaysOfWeek with the days of the week as named constants. We then create a function getDayOfWeek that takes a parameter of type DaysOfWeek and returns the corresponding day as a string. Finally, we declare a variable currentDay of type DaysOfWeek and log the current day using the getDayOfWeek function.

// The benefits of using enums in TypeScript include:

// Improved readability: Enums provide meaningful names for fixed values, making the code more readable and self-explanatory.

// Type safety: Enums restrict the possible values to a predefined set, preventing invalid values from being used.

// Auto-completion: IDEs can provide auto-completion and type-checking for enum values, reducing errors and improving developer productivity.

// Refactoring: Enums make it easier to refactor code by providing a centralized place to update constant values.

// Overall, enums in TypeScript are a powerful tool for defining and working with a set of related constants, improving code quality and maintainability.
