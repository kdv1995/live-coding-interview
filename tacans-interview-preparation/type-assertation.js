// Explain the purpose of type assertions in TypeScript. When should they be used?

//Answer:

// Type assertions in TypeScript are a way to tell the compiler about the type of a variable when the type cannot be inferred automatically. They are similar to type casting in other languages, but performed at compile-time rather than runtime. Type assertions are used when the developer knows more about the type of a value than the compiler does, and wants to override the default type inference.

// What is runtime in javascript? How does it work? What is the difference between compile time and runtime? Explain with examples. 

//Answer:

// Runtime in JavaScript refers to the period when a program is executed or running. During runtime, the JavaScript engine interprets and executes the code, interacting with the environment and producing the desired output. This is in contrast to compile time, where the code is analyzed and translated into machine-readable instructions before execution.
